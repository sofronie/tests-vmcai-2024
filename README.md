Tests: Automated Verification of the Correctness of a Subgraph Construction Algorithm
======================================================================================

We present the details of the tests we made. 
The tests are in the directory 

Subdirectory Axioms: Files for the axiom system
------------------------------------------------
- Basic properties of the axioms system
- Relation to axiom system of Hilbert and Tarski

Subdirectory IndependenceConsistence: 
======================================
- Independence of the axioms

Verification of the correctness proof
-------------------------------------
- <b> Subdirectory Proof:</b> Tests of the corectness proof
   - FILES
   - README

- <b> Subdirectory Counterexamples:</b> Counterexamples in a modified axiom system
   - FILES
   - README

Subdirectory Hilbert: 
=====================
Axioms of Hilbert for Order (2.1, 2.3, 2.4) are consequences of our axioms.
