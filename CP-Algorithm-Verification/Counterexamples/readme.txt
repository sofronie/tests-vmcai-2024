The counterexamples in this directroy show that without the coexistence property a redundancy cycle can occour.

For the counterexamples that are constructed in those test, no connected intersection-free subgraph exists.

The test counterexample refers to a redundancy cycle of length 3.

The test counterexample_length4 refers to a redundancy cycle of length 4.

In the same way arbitrary long redundancy cycles can be constructed.


The test proof_part1_without_coexistence showes that part1 of the corectness proof does not hold anymore, if the coexistence property is droped and outputs a model as counterexample.
