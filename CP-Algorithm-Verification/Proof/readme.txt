The test in this directory correspond to the parts and steps in the corectness proof.

The tests of part1 prove that for an edge u1v1 which is not in the intersection-free subgraph, allways an intersecting edge exists which is in F after the termination of the algorithm.

The tests of part2 show that a sequence of this intersecting edges can not be cyclic.
