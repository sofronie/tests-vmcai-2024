The tests in this directory show that all axioms are idependent of each other.

The axiom system is therefore minimal, i.e no subset of axiom system satisies all properties of the axiom system.

The test axiom_XY, where XY is the name of the considered axiom outputs a model where the axiom XY is not satisfied, but all the other axioms are.
axiom_XY.smt is the input file and axiom_XY.out the output file.

The test axiom_A5_5points showes that axiom A5 is implied by the other axioms if at least 5 different points exist.
